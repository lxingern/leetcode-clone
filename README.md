## leetcode-clone

This is a simple clone of LeetCode developed with Typescript, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Firebase. This is not an original project - it was created by following along with a tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org on Youtube ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnodscC2p-A&t) to video).

This project has been deployed using Vercel - view the app [here](https://leetcode-clone-lxingern.vercel.app/)!
